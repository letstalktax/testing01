        <section id="accounting-standards-section">
            <h2>4. Accounting Standards and UAE Corporate Tax</h2>
            <p>The document highlights the use of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as the basis for financial statement preparation. UAE Corporate Tax Law mandates the use of IFRS or IFRS for SMEs for determining Taxable Income (Article 20 of the UAE Corporate Tax Law). </p>
            <p><b>Table 1: Permitted Accounting Standards</b></p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Accounting Standard</th>
                    <th>Revenue Threshold</th>
                    <th>UAE Corporate Tax Compliance</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>IFRS</td>
                    <td>No threshold</td>
                    <td>Permitted</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>IFRS for SMEs</td>
                    <td>Revenue â‰¤ AED 50 million</td>
                    <td>Permitted</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Other Standards</td>
                    <td>Any Revenue</td>
                    <td>Not Permitted for CT purposes</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Note 2 of the Example Financial Statements mentions 'statement of compliance with IFRS'. Compliance with IFRS is crucial for businesses operating in the UAE to accurately determine their Taxable Income under UAE CT Law.</p>

        <section id="going-concern-section">
            <h2>5. Going Concern and Economic Uncertainty</h2>
            <p>The 'Important Disclaimer' and Note 2 emphasize the impact of economic uncertainty on financial reporting and the critical nature of going concern assessments. IAS 1, as cited in Note 2, requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the reporting date. </p>
            <p><b>Table 2: Going Concern Considerations under UAE CT</b></p>
            <table>
                <tr>

                    <td>Economic Uncertainty (COVID-19, Inflation)</td>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>For UAE CT purposes, a robust going concern assessment, considering current economic uncertainties, is vital as it underpins the financial statements used for tax calculations.</p>

        <section id="climate-related-matters-section">
            <h2>6. Climate-Related Matters and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>The 'Climate-related matters' section and Note 4.3 highlight the increasing importance of climate-related risks and opportunities in financial reporting. While IFRS standards don't explicitly mention climate change, IAS 1 and IAS 8 require disclosure of material information, including climate-related risks, that could influence users' decisions (Article 112 of IAS 1). </p>
            <p><b>Table 3: Climate-Related Disclosures under UAE CT</b></p>

                    <td>Climate-related matters can be material even if the numerical impact is not, requiring qualitative and quantitative assessment for tax compliance.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>For UAE CT, companies should consider disclosing climate-related risks and their potential financial impacts, as these disclosures are part of the financial statements used to determine Taxable Income.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="related-party-transactions-section">
            <h2>7. Related Party Transactions</h2>
            <p>Note 32 of the Example Financial Statements addresses related party transactions. UAE Corporate Tax Law, under Article 34, mandates that transactions with Related Parties must adhere to the arm's length principle.</p>

                    <td>Disclosure (Note 32)</td>
                    <td>While the example discloses related party transactions as per IFRS, specific disclosures may be required under UAE CT law, particularly for transfer pricing documentation.</td>
