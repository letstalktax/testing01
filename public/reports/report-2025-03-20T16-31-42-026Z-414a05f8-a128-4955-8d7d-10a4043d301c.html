            <td>12,287,061</td>
            <td>5,679,672</td>

<h3>3.2. Statement of Financial Position Highlights</h3>
<p>Key observations from the Statement of Financial Position:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Balance Sheet Item</th>
            <th>31 Dec 2023 (AED)</th>
            <th>31 Dec 2022 (AED)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Total Assets</td>
            <td>26,703,481</td>
            <td>29,506,038</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Total Equity</td>
            <td>(1,745,445)</td>
            <td>(135,157,758)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Total Liabilities</td>
            <td>28,448,926</td>
            <td>164,663,796</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Total assets have decreased, and the company continues to have negative equity.  There is a significant reduction in total liabilities from 2022 to 2023, primarily due to a large 'Net movement during the year' in accumulated loss, which appears to be a correction or capital injection.  However, the company's equity position remains weak.</p>

<h3>3.3. Cash Flow Analysis</h3>
<p>The Statement of Cash Flows reveals challenges in operational cash generation:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Cash Flow Category</th>
            <th>2023 (AED)</th>
            <th>2022 (AED)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Net Cash from Operating Activities</td>
            <td>(138,605,408)</td>
            <td>32,799,440</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Net Cash from Investing Activities</td>
            <td>1,281,832</td>
            <td>(28,343)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Net Cash from Financing Activities</td>
            <td>138,097,508</td>
            <td>(32,938,628)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Net (Decrease) / Increase in Cash</td>
            <td>773,932</td>
            <td>(167,531)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>In 2023, the company experienced a significant negative cash flow from operating activities.  This is offset by positive cash flow from financing activities, largely due to a 'Net movement in accumulated loss' of AED 138,097,508.  This financing activity is crucial for maintaining liquidity, but the negative operating cash flow is a concern for long-term sustainability.</p>

<h2>4. Tax Implications</h2>

<h3>4.1. Corporate Tax</h3>
<p>The UAE introduced corporate tax on business profits effective for financial years starting on or after 1 June 2023.  While these financial statements are for the year ending 31 December 2023, the applicability of corporate tax for Gourmet Gulf Co. LLC in 2023 would depend on the start date of their financial year.  Given the net loss reported for 2023, it is unlikely that the company will have a corporate tax liability for this period. However, it is crucial to monitor future profitability and ensure compliance with corporate tax regulations as the business evolves.</p>

<h3>4.2. Value Added Tax (VAT)</h3>
<p>As a restaurant business in the UAE, Gourmet Gulf Co. LLC is subject to VAT. The presence of 'VAT payable' in the accrued expenses indicates that the company is registered for VAT and is likely compliant with VAT regulations.  Continued adherence to VAT rules, including accurate record-keeping and timely filing of returns, is essential.</p>

<h3>4.3. Transfer Pricing</h3>
<p>The financial statements reveal significant transactions and balances with related parties.  Note 14 highlights substantial 'Due from related parties' and 'Due to a related party' balances.  It is imperative that these related party transactions are conducted at arm's length to comply with potential transfer pricing regulations and to ensure that transactions are commercially justifiable.  Proper documentation should be maintained to support the arm's length nature of these transactions.</p>

<h2>5. Compliance and Going Concern</h2>

<h3>5.1. Going Concern</h3>
<p>The Director's Report and Note 2.4 explicitly mention the going concern uncertainty due to accumulated losses and negative equity. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, relying on the expectation of continued financial support from shareholders.  It is critical for the company to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Regularly assess and document its going concern status.</li>
    <li>Obtain and document formal commitments of financial support from shareholders.</li>
    <li>Implement strategies to improve profitability and cash flow to reduce reliance on external funding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2. Financial Reporting Standards</h3>
<p>The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The notes indicate adoption of new and amended standards effective from 1 January 2022 and disclosure of standards not yet effective.  Continued adherence to IFRS and staying updated with new pronouncements is necessary for maintaining compliance and ensuring accurate financial reporting.</p>

<h3>5.3. Audit Opinion</h3>
<p>The financial statements are audited by Spicer Pegler Accounting.  While the audit opinion is not included in the provided document extract, it is important to review the full auditor's report for any qualifications or emphasis of matter paragraphs, particularly concerning going concern or other significant risks.</p>
