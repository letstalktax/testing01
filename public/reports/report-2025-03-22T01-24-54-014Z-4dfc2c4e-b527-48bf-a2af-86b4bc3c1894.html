        <p><b>Analysis:</b> Note 14 reveals significant transactions and balances with related parties.  The "Due from related parties" and "Due to related party" balances are substantial, indicating a high volume of intercompany activity.  These transactions must be reviewed to ensure they adhere to the Arm's Length Principle as per Article 34 of the UAE Corporate Tax Law. Potential Transfer Pricing risks exist if these transactions are not conducted at Market Value.</p>

            <li><span class="action-required">Action Required:</span> Benchmark related party transactions against comparable uncontrolled transactions to ensure arm's length pricing. Prepare Transfer Pricing documentation to support the arm's length nature of these transactions, as per Ministerial Decision No. 97 of 2023, especially for revenue exceeding AED 200 million or being part of MNE group.</li>
            <li><span class="action-required">Action Required:</span>  Specifically analyze the "Sales" and "Direct expenses" transactions with related parties (Note 14.2) to confirm arm's length pricing.</li>

        <p><b>Analysis:</b> Note 4 indicates significant Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) with a cost of AED 27,405,529 and accumulated depreciation of AED 24,209,207.  Depreciation is a deductible expense under UAE Corporate Tax Law. Review depreciation rates and methods applied to ensure they are reasonable and in line with UAE CT Law and accepted accounting standards. No amortization is charged in 2023, while significant amortization was charged in 2022 (Note 18), this needs further investigation to understand the change and ensure compliance.</p>

Under Article 30 of the UAE Corporate Tax Law, the General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule may apply, potentially limiting the deductibility of Net Interest Expenditure to 30% of EBITDA or AED 12 million, whichever is higher.  Given the operating loss, the deductibility of finance charges needs careful assessment.</p>
