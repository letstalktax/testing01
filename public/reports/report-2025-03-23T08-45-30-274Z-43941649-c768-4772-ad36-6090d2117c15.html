These transactions must be reviewed to ensure they are conducted at arm's length, in accordance with Article 34 of the UAE Corporate Tax Law. Transactions with entities in KSA and Qatar may require additional scrutiny due to cross-border implications.</p>
        <p><b>Specific Transactions Requiring Arm's Length Review:</b></p>

        </ul>
        <p><b>Action Required:</b></p>

        <h4>5.3.2 Depreciation & Amortization</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Review the company's depreciation and amortization policies to ensure they are in line with acceptable accounting standards as per Ministerial Decision No. 114 of 2023.</li>
            <li>Maintain a detailed fixed asset register with acquisition dates, costs, depreciation methods, and useful lives for all depreciable assets.</li>

Review the nature of accrued expenses to ensure they meet the deductibility criteria under Article 28 of the Corporate Tax Law, i.e., incurred wholly and exclusively for the business and not capital in nature.
