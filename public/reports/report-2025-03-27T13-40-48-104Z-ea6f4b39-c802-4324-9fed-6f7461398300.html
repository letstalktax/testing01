        <h2 class = "no-border">Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
           Gourmet Gulf Co. LLC reported a net loss of AED 4,685,195 for the year ended 31 December 2023. The company's revenue of AED 15,683,005 makes it ineligible for Small Business Relief.  Significant related party transactions and balances exist, requiring careful review for Transfer Pricing compliance.  The company is a juridical person, resident in the UAE, and is therefore subject to Corporate Tax.  Immediate actions are recommended for CT registration, transfer pricing documentation, and a thorough review of related party transactions.  There is a <span class="flag">going concern</span> risk that needs to be considered.

Key areas requiring immediate attention include Corporate Tax registration, transfer pricing compliance due to significant related party transactions, a detailed review of expenses for non-deductible items and a thorough review of the going concern assumption. The large negative movement in accumulated loss and cash flow will require further investigation.
