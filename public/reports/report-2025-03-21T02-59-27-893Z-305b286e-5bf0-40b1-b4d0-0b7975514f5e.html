    <h4 id="related_party_transactions">5.3.1 Related Party Transactions</h4>
    <p><b>Analysis:</b> Note 14 discloses significant related party balances and transactions. These transactions, particularly 'Due from related parties', 'Due to a related party', 'Sales', and 'Direct expenses', must be scrutinized to ensure compliance with the arm's length principle as per Article 34 of the UAE Corporate Tax Law. Potential Transfer Pricing risks exist if these transactions are not conducted at Market Value.</p>
    <p class="action-required"><b>Action Required:</b></p>

    <h4 id="depreciation_amortization">5.3.2 Depreciation & Amortization</h4>
    <p><b>Analysis:</b> Note 18 includes 'Depreciation' and 'Amortization' expenses within Administrative and General Expenses.  Review the company's depreciation and amortization policies, useful lives of assets, and methods applied to ensure they are in line with acceptable accounting standards and justifiable for Corporate Tax purposes.  While generally accounting depreciation is accepted, any accelerated depreciation or policies significantly deviating from industry norms may warrant further review.</p>
    <p class="action-required"><b>Action Required:</b></p>
