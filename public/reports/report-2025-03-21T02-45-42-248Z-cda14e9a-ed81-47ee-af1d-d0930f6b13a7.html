<h3>2.2. Statement of Financial Position Highlights</h3>

<h2>3. Tax Implications and Financial Findings</h2>

<h3>3.1. Accounting Standards and Method</h3>
<p>The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which is an accepted accounting standard for UAE Corporate Tax purposes as per Ministerial Decision No. 114 of 2023. The document mentions historical cost convention is used for basis of preparation, which is also compliant.</p>

<h3>3.2. Going Concern and Accumulated Losses</h3>
<p>The Director's Report and Notes to the Financial Statements mention accumulated losses and negative shareholders' equity, raising a going concern issue. However, the notes state that the going concern assumption is maintained based on the expectation of continued shareholder funding. This is a critical point for tax compliance, as it indicates potential financial instability, but is mitigated by shareholder support according to management's assessment.</p>

<h3>3.3. Related Party Transactions</h3>
<p>The financial statements reveal significant transactions and balances with related parties, both 'Due from' and 'Due to'. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Due from related parties:</b> Emarati Modern Rest. Co - KSA (IC), Gourmet Gulf Investment - UAE (IC), Al Tamuz International KSA (PXTMM) (IC), Royal Avenue Investments LLC, High Concept-Related Party, Daud Arabian Trading Company_ Related Party.</li>
    <li><b>Due to related party:</b> Azkadenya - Qatar (IC), Appetite FoodStuff Trading - Qatar (IC), King Fu Investments - UAE (IC), Middle East Retail Arabia, Mr. Sami Kamal Daud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transactions with related parties must adhere to the arm's length principle under UAE Corporate Tax Law (Article 34). It is crucial to ensure that these transactions are properly documented and justified at market value to avoid potential transfer pricing adjustments by the FTA. The notes mention that related party transactions are in the normal course of business and at arm's length, except for revenue related transactions. This statement should be substantiated with robust documentation.</p>

<h3>3.4. Revenue Recognition</h3>
<p>Revenue is recognized at a point in time, which is consistent with IFRS 15 and generally accepted for restaurant businesses. Revenue is geographically allocated within the UAE, aligning with the company's operational location in Dubai.</p>

<h3>3.5. Financial Risk Management</h3>
<p>Note 21 discusses financial risk factors, including market risk (interest rate risk, currency risk, other price risk), credit risk, and liquidity risk.  The company states it is not exposed to currency risk due to the AED-USD peg. However, interest rate risk and credit risk are mentioned, and the company should have documented policies and procedures to manage these risks, especially given the significant related party balances.</p>

<h3>3.6. Share Capital and Shareholders</h3>
<p>The share capital is reported as AED 100,000, with shareholders listed as Nadia Zaal Mohammad, Ghassan Saroufim, and Adib Moukheiber. Any changes in shareholding or capital structure during 2023 should be documented and assessed for tax implications, although the statement of changes in equity indicates no change in share capital during the year.</p>

<h3>3.7. Audit Requirement</h3>
<p>The financial statements include an Independent Auditor's Report from Spicer Pegler Accounting, indicating that the financial statements are audited.  As the revenue exceeds AED 50 million in 2022, audited financial statements are mandatory as per Ministerial Decision No. 82 of 2023.</p>

<h3>3.8. Cash Basis of Accounting Eligibility</h3>
<p>Based on the revenue figures provided, GOURMET GULF CO.LLC exceeds the AED 3 million revenue threshold for using the Cash Basis of Accounting. Therefore, the Accrual Basis of Accounting is correctly applied. </p>

<h3>3.9. Realisation Basis</h3>
<p>The report does not explicitly mention the Realisation Basis. If the company has elected to use the Realisation Basis for tax purposes, this election and its implications on the recognition of gains and losses should be documented and consistently applied.</p>

<h3>3.10. Transitional Rules</h3>
<p>The document does not provide information to assess the applicability of transitional rules. If the company owns Qualifying Immovable Property, Qualifying Intangible Assets, or Qualifying Financial Assets and Liabilities acquired before its first Tax Period, transitional rules may be relevant, and elections should be considered and documented in the first tax return.</p>

<h2>4. Compliance Recommendations</h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Transfer Pricing Documentation:</b>  Given the significant related party transactions, it is highly recommended that GOURMET GULF CO.LLC prepares and maintains robust Transfer Pricing documentation to support the arm's length nature of these transactions. This documentation should include a detailed functional analysis, comparability studies, and justification for the pricing methodologies used.</li>
    <li><b>Going Concern Assessment:</b> Continuously monitor the financial performance and shareholder support to ensure the validity of the going concern assumption. Document any changes in shareholder commitment or financial stability.</li>
    <li><b>Cash Flow Management:</b> Address the negative cash flow from operating activities. Implement strategies to improve operational cash flow and reduce reliance on financing activities.</li>
    <li><b>Tax Elections:</b> Review and document whether the company has made or should make elections for Realisation Basis or Transitional Rules in its Corporate Tax return.</li>
    <li><b>Audit Trail:</b> Maintain a clear audit trail for all financial transactions, especially those with related parties, and ensure all accounting policies are consistently applied and well-documented.</li>
    <li><b>Review of Accrued Expenses and Payables:</b> Investigate the significant increase in 'Due to a related party' and 'Accrued expenses and other payables' from 2022 to 2023 to ensure proper classification and justification.</li>
</ol>
