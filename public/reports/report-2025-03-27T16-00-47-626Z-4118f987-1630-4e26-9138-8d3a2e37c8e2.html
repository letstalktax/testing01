    <h2>GOURMET GULF CO.LLC</h2>
    <h3>For the Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023</h3>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            GOURMET GULF CO.LLC (the "Company") reported a net loss of AED (4,685,195) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The company appears to be a Resident Juridical Person for UAE CT purposes. The company's revenue of AED 15,683,005 exceeds the Small Business Relief threshold of AED 3 million, making it ineligible for SBR.  Significant related party transactions and balances are present, requiring thorough transfer pricing documentation and adherence to the arm's length principle. The large accumulated losses and negative equity raise significant going concern issues, which are acknowledged in the notes to the financial statements. The company should prioritize addressing these financial challenges and ensure full compliance with UAE CT regulations, particularly in relation to transfer pricing and interest deductibility.
