            <p>Based solely on the provided financial statements, it's not possible to definitively determine eligibility for Small Business Relief. Eligibility for Small Business Relief depends on Revenue. For the year ended 31 December 2023, Revenue is AED 15,683,005, and for the year ended 31 December 2022, Revenue is AED 20,387,980.  As Revenue exceeds AED 3 Million in both financial years, Gourmet Gulf Co.LLC is <b>likely not eligible</b> for Small Business Relief for the Tax Period ending 31 December 2023, unless there are exceptional circumstances approved by the FTA or further clarification on revenue definition suggests otherwise. <cite>[Ministerial Decision No. 73 of 2023 on Small Business Relief]</cite></p>
