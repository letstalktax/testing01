                <p>---SUMMARY---</p>
                <p>Based on the provided financial statements for Gourmet Gulf Co LLC for the year ended 31 December 2023, this report provides a detailed analysis from a UAE Corporate Tax compliance perspective. Key findings indicate a net loss for the year, which impacts the immediate Corporate Tax liability. However, several areas require careful review for potential tax adjustments, including related party transactions, depreciation, finance charges, and accrued expenses. Gourmet Gulf Co LLC is likely considered a Resident Juridical Person and is subject to the standard 9% Corporate Tax rate if taxable income is generated in future periods. Eligibility for Small Business Relief is not evident based on the provided financials due to losses.  </p>
                <p>Recommendations include a thorough review of related party transactions to ensure arm's length pricing, documentation of depreciation policies, analysis of interest deductibility under the General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule, and verification of accrued expenses. Implementing these recommendations will enhance tax compliance and potentially optimize the company's tax position in the UAE.</p>

The deductibility of finance charges is subject to the General Interest Deduction Limitation Rule under Article 30 of the Corporate Tax Law, which limits deductibility to 30% of EBITDA or AED 12 million, whichever is higher.
