    <h2>GOURMET GULF CO. LLC</h2>
    <h3>For the Financial Year Ended 31 December 2023</h3>

    <div class="summary-box">
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>
            GOURMET GULF CO. LLC, operating in the restaurant business, reported a net loss of AED 4,685,195 for the year ended 31 December 2023.  The company is subject to UAE Corporate Tax as a resident juridical person.  While the reported revenue of AED 15,683,005 exceeds the AED 3 million threshold for Small Business Relief (SBR), making SBR unavailable, the company's accumulated losses raise significant going concern issues.  Key areas requiring immediate attention include related party transactions, substantial accumulated losses, and the negative equity position.  The company must ensure proper documentation and compliance with transfer pricing regulations.  The high value of related party balances, particularly due to a related party (AED 17,899,689), warrants careful review for CT implications.
