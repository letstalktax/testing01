            <div>---SUMMARY---</div>
            <div>Based on the provided financial statements for Gourmet Gulf Co LLC for the year ended 31 December 2023, our analysis indicates that the company is a Resident Juridical Person under UAE Corporate Tax Law.  The applicable Corporate Tax rate is expected to be 9% on Taxable Income exceeding AED 375,000, although based on current losses, no tax is estimated to be payable.  Key areas requiring attention for UAE Corporate Tax compliance include related party transactions, depreciation policies, finance charges, and accrued expenses.  We recommend Gourmet Gulf Co LLC to implement robust Transfer Pricing documentation, review depreciation methods for tax optimization, ensure compliance with interest deduction limitations, and rigorously verify accrued expenses for tax deductibility. Loss carry forward provisions should be tracked for future tax relief.</div>
