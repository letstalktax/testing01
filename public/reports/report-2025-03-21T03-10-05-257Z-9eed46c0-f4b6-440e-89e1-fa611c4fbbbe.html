            <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This report provides a detailed analysis of the financial statements of GOURMET GULF CO.LLC for the year ended 31 December 2023, from a UAE Corporate Tax compliance perspective. Our analysis indicates that while the company experienced revenue growth in 2023 compared to 2022, it continues to operate at a net loss. Key areas requiring attention for UAE Corporate Tax compliance include related party transactions, finance charges, and loss carry forward.  We recommend a thorough review of related party transactions to ensure arm's length pricing, detailed documentation of finance charges to support deductibility, and careful tracking of tax losses for potential future offset. </p>
            <p>Further investigation and documentation in these areas are crucial to ensure full compliance with UAE Corporate Tax Law and to optimize the company's tax position in the future. The company is likely subject to the standard 9% Corporate Tax rate, however, given the current losses, no tax is estimated to be payable for the period. Eligibility for Small Business Relief is not met due to accumulated losses exceeding the threshold.</p>
